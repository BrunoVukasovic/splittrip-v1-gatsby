# KLIS & SALONA

KLIS fortress is famous for its supreme position and the historical role it played. It was built overlooking the mountain pass between surrounding Mosor and Kozjak mountains, protecting the coastal area with Ilyrian, Roman and Slavic inhabitants from inland invaders (barbarians and Ottomans) for centuries.
<br /> <br /> 
Once upon a time it was the seat of Croatian kings, Venetians and Austrians. During WWII the fortress was last used for military purposes; it was a stronghold of Italian and German occupation forces. It gained world fame as a city of Meeren in popular Game of Thrones series. Its magnificent walls and passages offer an abundance of history and probably the most spectacular view of Split, mountains and islands you can witness! The excavations started at the beginning of last century, still undergoing, and as it looks now, it will be a never-ending story. Literally, wherever you start digging, something is found!
<br /> <br />
SALONA is a very special archaeological site, due to its very unusual destiny. Namely, the biggest Roman city of the whole area, with around 60.000 inhabitants at the highest of its power, massive stone walls, forum with great temples, amphitheater, theater, early christian basilicas, sophisticated sewage and street systems were completely devastated in Avar and Slavic raid in the early 7th century. As opposed to numerous sites hit by similar destiny, Salona never got inhabited afterwards, thus for centuries covered under soil, debris and grass.
