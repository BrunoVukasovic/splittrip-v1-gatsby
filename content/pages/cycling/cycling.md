# Cycling

Cross country cycling throughout paths, fields and hillsides of the Dalmatian hinterland, by the lakeshore of Lake Peruča and canyon of the river Cetina ... real sources of life through the history and legacy. Let’s taste and enjoy our local premium wine varieties, traditional Dalmatian prosciutto and cheese from local pastures in authentic surroundings of a traditional eco-ethno village near the picturesque and historic town of Vrlika or somewhere outdoors in the wild ;)
<br /> <br /> 
To cherish the memory of your particular outdoor experience with us, we leave to all trip participants a unique photo memento by means of social networks.
<br /> <br /> 
We guarantee small initial groups, a complete pleasure and the safety of each individual.
