# Canyoning on Cetina

We will pick you up at arranged meeting points (if you take a transfer). Following the highway we will reach Zadvarje. Getting ready for the truly exciting adventure along the Cetina River canyon follows our arrival. After instructors provide you with a life-jacket, a helmet, a long neoprene pants and jacket, the small expedition will be ready for the unknown. Our tour guide will help you to get familiar with the route and rules of the excursion to ensure the safety of all participants.

What is canyoning? You slowly go down the canyon while the sound of the river amplifies, so after a ten-minute walk you will find yourself deep in the canyon carved by Cetina River. You walk through the river and rapids, pass through subterranean tunnels, swim in natural river basins, bypass waterfalls and lakes...That is canyoning experience! Swimming in the lake into which the waterfall thunders from a height of 60m and the climb to the “step” behind the “water curtains” will be an experience worth remembering. For thousands of years Cetina River has been flowing persistently through the canyon, creating magical shapes in its bed. Crystal clear and pleasant for swimming, the Cetina River today represents the genuine experience of the intact nature with its 180 meters high cliffs, wild rapids, basins, lakes, subterranean tunnels and a 60 meters high waterfall called Gubavica.
