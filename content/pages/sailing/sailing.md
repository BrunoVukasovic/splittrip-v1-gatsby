# Sailing

Set sail with us and cruise to the islands of Šolta, Brač or Čiovo on an unforgettable sailing tour. Anchor in secluded bay, discover rich underwater life while snorkeling. Visibility in the Adriatic can be clear up to 30 meters so snorkeling is a must.
<br /> <br /> 
Swim in crystal clear Adriatic sea while our chef prepares light Dalmatian lunch with fresh ingredients. During lunch indigenous Croatian eco-wines will be served on the boat.
<br /> <br /> 
Tour departs at 10 am and return to Split is around 5 pm. There is no strict route here as sailing depends on the weather conditions but we know that islands Brac, Solta and Ciovo will reveal their pristine beauty and implant unforgettable memories.
<br /> <br /> 
Maximum number of person on the boat is 8. Boat can also be rented for private sail.
<br /> <br /> 
This one day trip is the perfect choice to explore the whole area around Split.
