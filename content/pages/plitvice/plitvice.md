# Plitvice lakes

Immerse yourself in exceptional natural beauty, in a place so magical you can't even believe it exists. A magical mix of waterfalls and lakes, all set against a lush green backdrop, this national park is a must. 
<br /> <br /> 
In about three and a half hours drive we arrive to Plitvice National Park, the largest, the oldest and most famous national park in Croatia, which was declared as UNESCO world heritage in 1979. (among the first in the world). Plitvice Lakes National Park is a special geological and hydrogeological phenomenon with natural and rich biodiversity. The oldest national park in Croatia represents a forested mountain area and a series of 16 crystal blue lakes. Lakes receive water from numerous rivers and streams, and they are connected by cascades and waterfalls. Travertine barriers, which were made in the period of ten thousand years ago are one of the fundamental features of the park. Vast forests, extraordinary beauty of lakes and waterfalls, flora and fauna, contrasting autumn colors, trails and wooden bridges form a remarkable and unforgettable beauty.

Upon arriving at Plitvice you will walk through woodland. The path takes you across Upper Lakes and then it is time for boat ride within the sound of the waterfalls to Lower Lakes. Get ready to walk across the lake on charming wooden paths, as well as an unforgettable thunder produced by Great Falls, 78 meters high waterfall. Tour ends with a panoramic train ride through the forest, but after that there is a plenty of time for lunch at local tavern or for a picnic in the shade, next to the magnificent lake.
