# Dubrovnik

Excursion starts at the pre-arranged meeting point, where you will begin a full day of experiencing and discovering  famous walls of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
<br /> <br /> 
Drive in air-conditioned van goes along the winding coast and stops at several overlooks for amazing panoramic views of the Dalmatian islands.
<br /> <br /> 
Arrival to Dubrovnik (Croatia's most famous medieval city and also the “pearl of the Adriatic”) is around noon.
<br /> <br /> 
The tour begins at the monumental Pile Gate, built on the top of Stradun, a splendid main promenade street of the Old Town. You will get to sightsee Franciscan Monastery (its cloister is one of the most impressive sites in the city!) then stop by the oldest pharmacy in Europe opened in 1317. Nearby stands Sponza Palace, notable for its portico with columns and elaborate stone carvings which today houses the State Archives.
<br /> <br /> 
Tour ends with a visit to the Cathedral where you will learn more how it was built on the ruins of a 12th century church, then destroyed by the great earthquake of 1667. The guided tour lasts for about an hour and a half and after sightseeing the most important parts of the Old Town, there's time to go back and explore its hidden corners by yourself. You can climb the stairs to the walls that let you walk around the Old Town from high up on its ramparts or even take a cable car for a amazing view of the famous red tile roofs and the sea.

Dubrovnik leaves nobody unimpressed!
