# Mostar

The journey starts with driving between the Dalmatian coast and hinterland.
<br /> <br /> 
Our first destination is Mostar (ancient Ottoman city known as ˈthe window to the Orient'), where you will get to explore the Old Bazaar, full of picturesque shops and crafts workshops, then sightsee the Mosque.
<br /> <br /> 
Afterwards, you will enjoy a walk along the famous 16th century Turkish bridge. After guided tour you’ll have enough free time for shopping unique souvenirs and opportunity to taste authentic Bosnian specialties like ćevapi, pita or burek.
<br /> <br /> 
Last stop is amazing Kravica Waterfall to cool-off before we return to Split.
