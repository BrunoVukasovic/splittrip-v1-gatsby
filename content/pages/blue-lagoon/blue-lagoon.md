# Blue Lagoon

Nestled between the two Krknjaši islands, this enchanting lagoon is blessed with crystal clear waters, ideal for swimming, snorkeling and fun in the sun.
<br /> <br /> 
Our speedboat leaves from Riva, so you get to experience one of the best panoramic views of Split, prepare your cameras! After 30 minutes of exciting speed boat ride, we reach the first destination, the ancient city of Trogir, founded in the 3rd century BC and now UNESCO World Heritage site. Once you enter through the city gates (17th c) you find yourself in the maze of small stone streets, churches and palaces from the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque periods. Enjoy your coffee and breakfast within the city walls (15th c) or just outside them on a picturesque promenade overlooking Fortress Kamerlengo and the bay. An hour of free time is just enough to soak up a bit of history and move on to swimming activities!
<br /> <br /> 
The Blue Lagoon is a snorkeler’s utopia featuring crystal clear sea with sea floor made out of crushed sea shells mixed with sand which, under the sunlight, produce mesmerizing sea color. After exploring the seabed, turn to your back and just float effortlessly as you observe the trio of islands that ring you.
<br /> <br /> 
Snorkel masks are provided for you to discover the vibrant marine life!
