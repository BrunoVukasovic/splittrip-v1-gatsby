        <h2>Krka waterfalls</h2>
        <TripDescription>
          Adventure starts at our meeting point. We are on the way to Krka National park from Split in the air-conditioned mini-van or bus. <br /> <br /> 
          In about an hour and 30 minutes we arrive to Krka National Park and embark on a tour. First up is the charming town of Skradin where we take the <strong>30-minutes boat ride</strong> to Skradinski buk and back, one of the most famous Croatian natural beauties and the largest travertine waterfall in Europe.
          <br /> <br /> 
          Skradinski buk is the last of seven waterfalls on the Krka River but sure not the least as it creates most travertine cascades, islands and lakes. In over 17 steps of Skradinski buk, spread over 800 meters in length, lies one of the most unusual and beautiful landscape images of the National Park.
          <br /> <br />
          Our program includes a <strong>fascinating tour of an authentically restored ensemble of stone small houses</strong>, workshops, exhibits and watermills and a beautiful walk through forest pathways and wooden bridges designed to let you experience the rich diversity of flora and fauna there.
          <br /> <br />
          Enjoy the magnificent Skradinski buk, lunch and <strong>free time for swimming and paddling</strong> under a little waterfall; the perfect way to cool off in the sweltering summer day!
          The final adventure is a visit to a historic, seaside city of Sibenik, available only in March, April, May and October. The return to Split along the coast road is gorgeous â€“ picturesque villages and beautiful offshore islands.
          <br /> <br />
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> Guests should have proper clothing for taking the tour: sportswear, bathing suite, comfortable shoes, additional clothes for change. Out of season warm sweater.
