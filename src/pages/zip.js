        <h2>Zip Line Omis</h2>
        <TripDescription>
            Zipline is an adrenaline entertainment where guests descend through the canyon down the steel wire rope, secured with a belt. Adventure also includes training and a short walk in nature.
            <br /> <br /> 
            Zipline is located 3 km from Omis, in the canyon of the Cetina River and consists of eight wires total length of 2100m . Depending on the size of the group, zipline gives you up to 3 hours of unforgettable fun and beautiful nature .
            <br /> <br />
            We organized the transfer to the start and back (3 km from Omis) by our vehicle. Before the beginning, the group goes to the training ground and each guest receives equipment . There are two short wires, length 25m , where guides show you how to brake and act on cable. The next thing is a short walk to the first wire. During the walk, you can enjoy the beautiful, almost untouched nature and stunning views of the Cetina river canyon. Before each wire, one of the guides demonstrate descend, while the second guide attaches you and gives you instructions. First guide welcomes you at the beginning of the second wire. That is the system to pass all eight wires.
            <br /> <br />
            The finish point of a zipline tour is located 50m from the road, and there is our van waiting to take you back to Split.
